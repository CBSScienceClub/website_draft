          <p>The Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences (CEBS) is a joint academic venture of the University of Mumbai (UM) and the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India. The institute primarily offers 5-year integrated MSc courses in four streams of basic sciences, namely Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics. <br> Students join the centre through the National Entrance Screening Test (NEST) after completing 10+2 or equivalent level of schooling. All four subjects are taught in the first year, and students can opt the stream of their choice second year onwards. The centre was conceived by Prof. S. M. Chitre, Dr. Anil Kakodkar and others as a pilot project. </p>

          <p>CEBS was conceived to provide students with a sustainable academic and research environment within the country, and the Club's intentions resonate with the motive of the Centre. We are a team of student volunteers from different years and streams at the institute, and through our events we take an active part in building that environment and integrating the community. Our sessions also motivate independent pursuit of knowledge, and strengthen the relationship of the community with the world of research. Read more in our blog.

          <h1>Rendezvous</h1><p class="info">In these sessions we invite researchers and host a lively dialogue of students with them. The conversation often begins around a central scientific theme in an informal and comfortable setting. We facilitate and encourage students to ask questions, which bring out more elaborate perspectives from the discussion. We also talk about the impressions and experiences of our guests throughout their journey in the field, and try to get more detailed glimpses of practising research.</p>

          <h1>Open Mic</h1><p class="info">Open Mics provide students with an opportunity to explore their scientific interests and share them with the community. The session begins with 5-6 students briefly introducing a topic of their interest. This is followed by a discussion session, where the speakers elaborate on their topic with smaller groups of students in greater depth.</p>

          <h1>Baithak</h1><p class="info">Baithak is a unique platform for students to express their thoughts and feelings. It encourages us to understand fellow students at a more personal level and realizes the importance of observing compassion in our conduct. The format is very similar to open mics, except what students want to share need not be related to science and need not be prepared beforehand. The setting of the session is also cozier</p>

          <h1>Counselling</h1><p class="info">These sessions help students to make better academic decisions for themselves. We have had a variety of such events in the past, where we invite some of our professors to advise us as to how we can make the best utilization of our academic opportunities. These include the Counseling session for the prospective students willing to join CEBS, and 'Building a Scientist' for the existing students. We have also had Alumni interaction sessions, which gave us a peek into the academic life ahead of our integrated MSc course.</p>
