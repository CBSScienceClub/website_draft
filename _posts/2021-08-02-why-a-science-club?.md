## Resources in colleges

When students reach college they see a completely different environment than what they've experienced till then. Just to have an idea of what kind of resources are offered by a college, we tell a little bit about our own institute before initiating the discussion on the purpose of our club[^1]. UM-DAE CEBS is a small community, and the typical strength of a class (second year onwards) is 8-9 students. We have a very limited number of in-house faculty members. Most of the courses are taught by either superannuated or currently active researchers, who have been or are a part of leading research and academic institutes of Mumbai like BARC, TIFR, IITB, HBCSE and NIRRH. Our professors encourage asking doubts, include historical as well as recent developments of the subject, and give glimpses of how the knowledge can be applied in research.

[^1]:  In case you are familiar with the academics at CEBS, kindly move on to the next section.
